			<h3><strong>The Calendar</strong></h3>
				<div id="body">
					
						The calendar is available on the home screen to allow for optimum viewing without taking any extra steps
						after you log in. The calendar is already preconfigured to show any event you've signed up for. 
						Typically they are in green, however events cancelled by a volunteer or coach appear red 
						to let you know that the event is cancelled (rather than simply disappearing).
					
					<p>
						Clicking an event on the calendar allows you to take a closer look at it, allowing you to see details such as 
						when it starts and ends, how much room is left for new people to participate, and where it is.
					</p>
				</div>

		<div id="CreateEvent">
			<h3><strong>Creating an Event</strong></h3>
				<div id="body">
			
						To create an event, simply click the "Add Event" button in the top bar. You will be greeted with a form,
						which will only be accepted if all applicable fields are filled out correctly. Upon submission,
						the event will be added to the calendar, and students and volunteers will be able to sign up for the event.
				<p></p>
				</div>
		</div>
		
		<div id="ModEvent">
			<h3><strong>Modifying an Event</strong></h3>
				<div id="body">
					
						After an event is created, the user who created it is able to go back and change any of the event's details,
						or delete the event altogether. An administrator is allowed to modify or delete any event, even the ones or she
						is not the author of.
					<p>
						When an event is deleted, it will appear in red on the calendar, allowing users to see that the event was
						cancelled, allowing them to schedule accordingly.
					</p>
				</div>
		</div>
		
		<div id="AddUser">
			<h3><strong>Adding Users</strong></h3>
				<div id="body">
						
						Throughout the course of the FIRST Robotics season, it will be necessary for administrators to add new players or volunteers.
						Administrators may add volunteers by logging on, clicking the "Modify Users" button in the top utility bar,
						and selecting the option to add a new user. Administrators are the only users capable of adding users, and it is assumed that all students
						participating will be added at the beginning of the season. 
					<p>
						New students or volunteers may be added later by contacting the Administrator.
						Because students and volunteers will have different user privileges, it is important that the administrator chooses
						the proper classification for each user.
